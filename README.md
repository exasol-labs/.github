**Welcome to the Exasol labs!**

`exasol-labs` is the GitHub organization where the Exasol community shares experimental and educational projects.

This is a space for developers to try out ideas, explore new concepts, and collaborate on non-production code.

> [!Important]
> The projects here are intended for learning and experimentation only â€” they're not officially supported and should not be used in production environments. We welcome contributions and encourage you to get involved!

For officially supported projects and production-grade tools, please visit the [`exasol`](https://github.com/exasol) organization on GitHub.
